# Interlace

This custom Bazzite image is based on `bazzite-gnome`. It includes Dank Material
Shell and niri along with all of the recommended extras for Dank Linux.

My goal with this image is to offer a vanilla DMS/niri experience with gaming
capabilities (via Bazzite). I have added ghostty as the default termianl along
with tools to allow developers to create their own DMS plugins.

Feel free to suggest additional software - or just fork this repo and do
whatever you like.

To switch, run the following from a terminal in any Universal Blue or Fedora
Atomic based install:

```
sudo bootc switch ghcr.io/irunatbullets/interlace
sudo bootc switch ghcr.io/irunatbullets/interlace-nvidia
```

I have also included these two variants based on `bazzite-dx-gnome`, for people
who might need more developement tools:

```
sudo bootc switch ghcr.io/irunatbullets/interlace-dx
sudo bootc switch ghcr.io/irunatbullets/interlace-dx-nvidia
```

**Important Note:** After switching to this image the login will backup any
existing niri configutation and replace it with standard dms niri configs.
Updates will not retrigger this event.

**Also:** To enable background image syncing with the dms greeter, run the
following from your terminal and follow the steps:

```
dms greeter sync
```
I would like to automate this in future but I'm simply not smart or patient
enough to do it at the moment.

## Flatpak theme support

Mutagen can theme flatpaks by running the following (restart any running apps):

```
sudo flatpak override \
--filesystem=xdg-config/gtk-3.0:rw \
--filesystem=xdg-config/gtkrc-2.0:rw \
--filesystem=xdg-config/gtk-4.0:rw \
--filesystem=xdg-config/gtkrc:rw
```
